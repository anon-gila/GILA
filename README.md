# GILA

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper submitted anonymously to ICLR.

Our implementation of GILA builds upon the publicly available IDGL codebase (NeurIPS 2020, Apache License 2.0).  
We modified the original IDGL implementation to develop and evaluate our proposed method.  
The original IDGL repository is available at: https://github.com/hugochan/IDGL

## Notes

- All author and affiliation information has been removed for anonymity.  
- This code is provided solely for the purpose of reproducibility in the ICLR review process.  
- This repository is entirely independent from the original IDGL authors.
